The Mindfulness app is a comprehensive tool designed to assist users in cultivating a healthier state of mind through meditation techniques and stress reduction methods. By integrating coroutines into its framework, the app optimizes performance and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience. Through a curated selection of mindfulness practices, users can explore various meditation techniques tailored to their needs, whether it's managing stress, alleviating anxiety, or enhancing overall well-being. The app leverages the concept of flow state to load data only when it is needed and then store the data for later use. 

Additionally, by utilizing persistent data storage, such as impressions and visit dates, the app enables users to track their progress and maintain consistency in their mindfulness practice, empowering them to make meaningful strides toward mental clarity and emotional balance. With its user-friendly interface and versatile features, the Mindfulness app serves as a valuable companion on the journey towards inner peace and personal growth. A recycler view is used so that an appropriate amount of items is displayed at once and so that the whole list does not have to be created on the spot. However, when the user scrolls down the page they will see that the data is populated and destroyed as they go to increase optimization.
